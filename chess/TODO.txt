* solve movegen bug rook moving diagnonaly over pawn to kill
* pieceType and file and rank numbers should have custom type
* FEM-string-parser for init position
* Fem-string debug output of previous position so when we see a bug while playing we can run that situation again
  (also a temp position with the previos, and a short cut to go back would be usefull)
* try out Catch2 unit testing
* find which method consumes most time using VS debug tools - it is very slow!
	-copy of map seems kandidate -> try changing to array
* implement movement evaluation
* one class for each evaluation inhering a base evaluator, could be neat
* one class for each piece inheriting piece and/or sliding piece
* implement alpha beta pruning
* make movegenerator non-static with public method getNextMove() and reset(), 
  so that we dont need to generate the moves that will be pruned anyways
* better modularization in movegenerator - to much duplicate code!
* install VM or docker with ubuntu and adapt code to run there
* test that we can find and choose check mate
* en pasan
* other promotions in movegeneration
* other promotions in gui
* naming eg. sideToMove rather than color
* move bitboard methods to own file
